    "### The basics of relational database systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can begin to develop database applications, you need to\n",
    "understand the basic concepts. Relational databases hold data. This data\n",
    "can be of different types, such as numbers, characters, or dates. Within\n",
    "the database, the data are organized into logical units called tables. A\n",
    "table is like a spreadsheet, because it contains rows of data. Each row\n",
    "is made up of a number of columns. The columns hold data of a specific\n",
    "data type, like integer values or strings of characters. In most cases,\n",
    "a database has more than one table. To relate the tables together, a\n",
    "database designer takes advantage of natural (or artificial) links\n",
    "between the tables. In a spreadsheet, you can link rows in different\n",
    "sheets by cell values. The same idea holds in a relational database, and\n",
    "the column used to make the link is referred to as a key column.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to understand the purpose of a table or a particular\n",
    "column, you should select appropriate names. The naming conventions can\n",
    "vary between databases. For a SQLite database, individual names:\n",
    "\n",
    "- by default, case insensitive (although this can be changed),\n",
    "\n",
    "- are unlimited in length, but should be kept to a reasonable length\n",
    "(given readability constraints),\n",
    "\n",
    "- must begin with a letter or an underscore character, and\n",
    "\n",
    "- must only code alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can escape these rules by placing the name in double quotation\n",
    "marks, which allows names to be case sensitive and to include additional\n",
    "characters (including spaces). Doing this, however, is generally a bad\n",
    "practice: It requires the name to always be enclosed in double quotation\n",
    "marks and can easily confuse someone else who may be maintaining your\n",
    "code. Finally, a name can not be one of the reserved [keywords](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_keywords.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Style\n",
    "\n",
    "For this class, we will follow a specific style: All SQL commands are\n",
    "presented entirely in uppercase, and item names use camelCase. In\n",
    "camelCase style, words are joined together, and the first letter of each\n",
    "word-following the first one-is capitalized, such as aLongIdentifier.\n",
    "Combining these two styles together, these articles write SQL commands\n",
    "using the following style: SELECT aLongIdentifier FROM dataTable ;.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Related tables are often grouped together into a schema. You can think\n",
    "of a schema as a container for all the related structure definitions\n",
    "within a particular database. A table name must be unique within a given\n",
    "schema. Thus, by using schemas, you can have identically named objects\n",
    "(such as tables) enclosed within different schemas. When you're using\n",
    "the Apache Derby database, a table is always in a schema. If you don't\n",
    "specify a schema explicitly, Derby implicitly uses the built-in apps\n",
    "schema. A second built-in schema called sys is used to isolate system\n",
    "tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the schema name to qualify a name. By default, SQLite uses\n",
    "the database name as the schema, and you do not need to prefix names to\n",
    "indicate the correct schema. For other databases, however, this is not\n",
    "the case. For these databases, you specify the schema name followed by a\n",
    "period and then the table name. For example, bigdog.products references\n",
    "the products table in the bigdog schema. Without the relevant schema\n",
    "name, a table name is said to be unqualified, as in products. When the\n",
    "schema name and the table name are completely specified, as in\n",
    "bigdog.products, the name is said to be fully qualified.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an abstract sense, these database concepts may seem confusing, but in\n",
    "practice they're fairly straightforward. For example, imagine you own a\n",
    "store called Bigdog's Surf Shop that sells a variety of items like\n",
    "sunglasses, shirts, and so on. If you want to be profitable, you must\n",
    "keep a close eye on your inventory so you can easily order additional\n",
    "inventory or change vendors to keep your overhead to a minimum. One\n",
    "simple method for tracking this information is to write entries in a\n",
    "table-like format:\n",
    "\n",
    "**<DIV ALIGN=CENTER>Product Table </DIV>**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Item# | Price | Stock Date | Description |\n",
    "| ---- | ----- | ---------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| 1 | 29.95 | 1/15/15 | Basic Sunglasses |\n",
    "| 2 | 9.95 | 12/14/14 | Generic Shirt |\n",
    "| 3 | 99.95 | 8/04/14 | Boogie Board |\n",

    "| ---- | ----- | ---------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| 1 | 101 | Mikal Arroyo |\n",
    "| 2 | 102 | Quiet Beach Industries |\n",
    "| 3 | 103 | Vista Luna |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From this simple visual design you can easily map the business logic\n",
    "straight into database tables. You have two database tables, Products\n",
    "and Vendors, which are naturally linked by the item number. The data\n",
    "types for the columns in each table are easy to determine. Later in this\n",
    "lesson we will actually create this sample schema for Bigdog's Surf\n",
    "Shop, which consists of these two tables, in a SQLite database. But\n",

    "### SQL: Structured Query Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Database systems can be complex pieces of software, especially when they\n",
    "scale to support enterprise-level applications. As a result, you may\n",
    "expect that every database has its own application programming interface\n",
    "(API) and that these APIs may be different from one system to the next.\n",
    "When relational databases were first developed, this was the case; but,\n",
    "fortunately, a number of vendors agreed to develop a standard language\n",
    "for accessing and manipulating relational databases. This language is\n",
    "officially called Structured Query Language (or SQL, pronounced\n",
    "sea-quill). Several official standard versions have been produced,\n",
    "including one in 1992 that is referred to as SQL-92, and one in 1999\n",
    "that is referred to as SQL-99. The Apache Derby database provides a\n",
    "nearly complete implementation of the SQL-92 standard, so applications\n",
    "developed with Derby can be easily transported to other database systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL has two main components: a Data Definition Language (DDL) and a Data\n",
    "Manipulation Language (DML). DDL commands are used to create, modify, or\n",
    "delete items (such as tables) in a database. DML commands are used to\n",
    "add, modify, delete, or select data from a table in the database. The\n",
    "rest of this article provides a basic introduction to the DDL components\n",
    "of SQL. Future articles will focus on the DML commands and more advanced\n",
    "DDL commands. \n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL data types\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL, being a programming language in its own right, defines a rich\n",
    "data-type hierarchy. Persisting these data types is one of the most\n",
    "important responsibilities of the database. As databases have become\n",

If you leave a particular column blank, what is inserted into the database? As you can imagine, this problem could be cumbersome if you had to track no value markers. Fortunately, SQL defines a special value, NULL, to indicate that a column has no value.\n",

    "### CREATE TABLE\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you've learned how to design a table, including mapping out the\n",
    "table columns and defining the data type for each column. After you've\n",
    "properly designed a table, the method for creating a table in SQL is\n",
    "straightforward. Listing 1 shows the formal syntax for creating a table\n",
    "in Derby.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-- Comment describing the purpose and layout of the table \n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE tableName ( { <columnDefinition> | <tableLevelConstraint> } \n",
    "    [, { <columnDefinition> | <tableLevelConstraint> } ]* ) ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may feel bewildered after looking at this syntax for the first time.\n",
    "But it's easy to follow once you have the basics down. The square\n",
    "brackets ([ and ]) enclose optional parameters. As you can see from the\n",
    "formal syntax, any column definitions or table-level constraints after\n",
    "the required initial one (it wouldn't make sense to create a table with\n",
    "no columns!) are optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably understand what is meant by a column definition, but you\n",
    "might not understand the idea of a constraint. Constraints come in two\n",
    "types: table-level constraints and column constraints. A constraint\n",
    "limits either a column or a table in some manner. For example, you can\n",
    "use a constraint to require that a column always be assigned an actual\n",
    "value (no NULL values), or that every entry in a column must be unique,\n",
    "or that a column is automatically assigned a default value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The asterisk (\\*) after the last closing square bracket indicates that\n",
    "more than one of the enclosing items can be included. This implies that\n",
    "the table must have one or more columns or table-level constraints. The\n",
    "vertical line (|) indicates an either/or condition. In this syntax\n",
    "example, you must either define a new column or define a new table-level\n",
    "constraint. The curly brackets ({ and }) group related items together,\n",
    "and the parentheses (( and )) are required elements. Finally, the\n",

    "#### SQLite Schema Creation\n",

    "myProducts table has four columns: itemNumber, price, stockDate, and\n",
    "description. The itemNumber column provides a unique identity for each\n",
    "item (or row) and has an attached column-level constraint that enforces\n",
    "a valid value to always be supplied (NOT NULL). Without this\n",
    "requirement, the itemNumber column isn't guaranteed to be unique because\n",
    "multiple columns could be assigned a NULL value. The price column is\n",
    "created as a REAL data type. The last two columns are simple: The\n",
    "stockDate column is stored as a TEXT (we can use application logic to\n",
    "transform the date/time information into and out of the appropriate\n",
    "YYYY-MM-DD format), and description is also stored in a TEXT field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The myVendors table has three columns: itemNumber, vendorNumber, and\n",
    "vendorName. In this case, both the itemNumber and vendorNumber columns\n",
    "have attached column-level constraints (NOT NULL). In addition, the\n",

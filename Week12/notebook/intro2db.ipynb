    "### Database Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might expect, working with these systems isn't trivial, and they\n",
    "can be expensive to operate. Historically, the tasks involved in working\n",
    "with these databases have been divided into three categories. Although\n",
    "the roles sometimes overlap, their individual responsibilities are easy\n",
    "to comprehend:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database administrator (DBA)**: Responsible for the overall operation\n",
    "of the database system, which includes the selection and layout of the\n",
    "underlying hardware, the installation and optimization of the database\n",
    "server (especially given the hardware being used), and the day-to-day\n",
    "operations of the database server, such as data backup and recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database developer**: Responsible for the actual databases in\n",
    "operation, including designing databases, schemas, tables, table\n",
    "relationships, and indexes as well as optimizing queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database application developer**: Responsible for integrating\n",
    "application code with the underlying database by using database\n",
    "application programming interfaces (APIs) to store and retrieve data as\n",
    "necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the previous discussion leaves you feeling intimidated, that's OK,\n",
    "working with databases has historically been difficult. To understand\n",
    "why, let's examine a specific example in more detail: online banking.\n",
    "When you connect to your bank's Web site, you provide your credentials\n",
    "(most likely a username and password) and thereby gain access to your\n",
    "financial accounts. You can view your data, pay bills, and transfer\n",
    "funds. The database your bank uses must quickly locate the relevant\n",
    "information, safely manage the transactions, securely interact with\n",
    "users, and *most important* not lose any data! And the bank must do\n",
    "this for a large number of users concurrently. To ensure these tasks are\n",
    "performed correctly, relational database systems are given a special\n",
    "test, known as the **ACID Test**.\n",
    "\n",

   ]

    "### The ACID Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Diamonds are obviously a valuable commodity,so valuable that\n",
    "counterfeits are a serious concern. One simple and (at least, in the\n",
    "movies) popular test to determine whether a diamond is real is to run it\n",
    "across a piece of glass. Because diamonds are one of the hardest\n",
    "materials known, a real diamond easily cuts the glass surface; a fake,\n",
    "especially if it's made of glass itself, won't.\n",
    "\n",
    "To a software developer, databases are equally valuable. If you use a\n",
    "database, you want to be sure it will safely store your data and let you\n",
    "easily retrieve the data later. You also want your database to allow\n",
    "multiple programs (or people) to work with the database without\n",
    "interfering with each other. To demonstrate, imagine you own a bank. The\n",
    "database for your bank must do the following, among other things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Safely store the appropriate data\n",
    "- Quickly retrieve the appropriate data\n",
    "- Support multiple, concurrent user sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks can be collectively referred to as the ACID test; ACID is an\n",
    "acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Atomicity** means that operations with the database can be grouped\n",
    "together and treated as a single unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consistency** guarantees that either all the operations in this single\n",
    "unit (or transaction) are performed successfully, or none of them is\n",
    "performed. In other words, a database can't be in an unfinished state.\n",
    "To understand why these characteristics are important, think about a\n",
    "bank transaction during which money is transferred from a savings\n",
    "account into a checking account. If the transfer process fails after\n",
    "subtracting the money from your savings account and before it was added\n",
    "to your checking account, you would become poorer, and the bank would\n",
    "have an angry (ex)customer! Atomicity enables the two operations -- the\n",
    "subtraction from the savings account and the addition to the checking\n",
    "account -- to be treated as a single transaction. Consistency guarantees\n",
    "that both operations in the transaction either succeed or fail. That\n",
    "way, your money isn't lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Isolation** means that independent sets of database transactions are\n",
    "performed in such a way that they don't conflict with each other.\n",
    "Continuing the bank analogy, consider two customers who transfer funds\n",
    "between accounts at the same time. The database must track both\n",
    "transfers separately; otherwise, the funds could go into the wrong\n",
    "accounts, and the bank might be left with two angry (ex)customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Durability** guarantees that the database is safe against unexpected\n",
    "terminations. It may be a minor inconvenience if your television or\n",
    "computer won't work when the power goes out, but the same can't be said\n",
    "for a database. If the bank's computers lose power when transferring\n",
    "your funds, you won't be a happy customer if the transaction is lost.\n",
    "Durability guarantees that if the database terminates abnormally during\n",
    "a funds transfer, then when the database is brought back up, it will be\n",
    "able to recover the transaction and continue with normal operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Passing the ACID test is nontrivial, and many simple databases fall\n",
    "short. For critical e-business or Web-based applications, passing the\n",
    "ACID test is a must. This is one of the reasons so many companies and\n",
    "individuals utilize enterprise-level database systems, such as IBM DB2,\n",
    "Oracle Database, or Microsoft SQL Server. These databases are fully\n",
    "compliant with the ACID test, and can meet many of the data persistence\n",
    "needs of large corporations or organizations. To do so, however, often\n",
    "requires a large team that includes database administrators, database\n",

    "### What is SQLite?\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is quite different than traditional relational database\n",
    "systems. SQLite does not have a separate server process, instead SQLite\n",
    "is a software library that, as the website states:\n",
    "\n",
    "> implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration,\n",
    "> transactional SQL database engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before progressing, lets examine each of these concepts in turn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *self-contained*: Nothing else is needed to use SQLite but the\n",
    "software library. Since, by default,  this comes with Python, we can use\n",
    "SQLite without any additional software downloads or installs. in\n",
    "addition, if you want to embed SQLite in your own application, you can\n",
    "obtain a single ANSI-C file that contains the entire SQLite library.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *serverless*: We interact with the SQLite database by using the\n",
    "SQLite library. The database is stored in a single file that is platform\n",
    "independent (so you can simply copy it over to a new machine with no\n",
    "further effort).\n",
    "\n",
    "- *zero-configuration*: SQLite does not use a server process, so there\n",
    "is no configuration required. While you can customize sqlite to change\n",
    "[default limits][1], for most applications this is unnecessary. You can\n",
    "also pre-specify certain options for the `sqlite3` command line client\n",
    "in a separate configuration file (e.g., `.sqliterc`, which is located in\n",
    "the current user's home directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "- *transactional*: A transaction is a logical set of operations. SQLite\n",
    "is ACID-complaint by implementing [atomic commits][2], which means that\n",
    "either every operation within the transaction completes successfully or\n",
    "none of them do. No partial writes are persisted, so that the database\n",
    "is always in a consistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this power, it is even more surprising that the SQLite library is\n",
    "quite small, and can be compacted to as small as **300 kb** if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite by default will store data in a single database file; however, it\n",
    "can also be used as an _in memory_ database. SQLite has been distributed\n",
    "as a component within the Python language for many years, but also has a\n",
    "stand-alone command line interface client, called `sqlite3` that we will\n",

    "### INSERT\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important tasks when you're building a database\n",
    "application is inserting data into the database. It doesn't matter how\n",
    "good the database software is-if you put bad data in a database, nothing\n",
    "else matters. There are several different ways to insert data into a\n",
    "database, but the rest of this lesson focuses on inserting data into a\n",
    "SQLite database by using the SQL INSERT statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can insert data into a SQLite database using the SQL INSERT\n",
    "statement, you must know how to properly use this statement. The full\n",
    "syntax for the SQL INSERT statement is\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "INSERT INTO table-Name\n",
    "    [ (Simple-column-Name [ , Simple-column-Name]* ) ]\n",
    "\t  Expression\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which should seem familiar. As discussed previously, the square brackets\n",
    "([]) enclose optional parameters. The only component whose purpose isn't\n",
    "immediately clear is _Expression_; but how complex can that simple\n",
    "phrase be? Of course, appearances can be deceiving; the Expression term\n",
    "can expand to one of four different structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a single-row VALUES list\n",
    "- a multiple-row VALUES list\n",
    "- a SELECT expression\n",
    "- a UNION expression\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these, the last two are beyond the scope of this lesson. The first\n",
    "two are similar; the only difference is that the first form inserts one\n",
    "row into a table, whereas the latter form inserts multiple rows into a\n",
    "table.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the optional part of the SQL INSERT statement to specify the\n",
    "column order of the values being inserted into the table. By default,\n",
    "data is inserted into a table's columns in the same order that the\n",
    "columns were listed when the table was created. Sometimes you may want\n",
    "to change this order or perhaps only specify values for columns that\n",
    "have NOT NULL constraints. By explicitly listing the columns in your SQL\n",
    "INSERT statement, you gain more control of the operation and can more\n",
    "easily handle these specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for the SQL VALUES expression is fairly simple,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "    VALUES ( Value {, Value }* )\n",
    "        [ , ( Value {, Value }* ) ]* |\n",
    "    VALUES Value [ , Value ]*\n",
    " }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This syntax displays the multiple-row format first, followed by the\n",
    "single-row format (remember that the vertical line character, |, means\n",
    "or and that the asterisk character, \\*, means one or more). The value\n",
    "term stands for a value that you want to insert into a specific column.\n",
    "To insert data into multiple columns, you must enclose the data for a\n",
    "row in parentheses separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown below, to insert data into a table, you first need to to make\n",
    "sure that the table exists. If you haven't already done so, execute the\n",
    "table creation scripts discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "INSERT INTO myProducts \n",
    "    VALUES(1, 19.95, '2015-03-31', 'Hooded sweatshirt') ;\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO myProducts(itemNumber, price, stockDate, description) \n",
    "    VALUES(2, 99.99, '2015-03-29', 'Beach umbrella') ;\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO myProducts(itemNumber, price, stockDate) \n",
    "    VALUES(3, 0.99, '2015-02-28') ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example presents three single-row inserts into the myProducts\n",
    "table. The first SQL INSERT statement doesn't provide a list of columns;\n",
    "it inserts an itemNumber, a price, a stockDate, and a description.\n",
    "Notice that the values inserted into both the stockDate and description\n",
    "columns are enclosed in single quote characters. The description column\n",
    "is a TEXT field, so it expects a string (which you indicate by enclosing\n",
    "the character data within single quotes). The stockDate column is also a\n",
    "TEXT field; as part of our application logic, we could pass in dates in\n",
    "the correct day, month, and year format. (For more guidance on the\n",
    "format of data types during a SQL INSERT operation, read the SQLite\n",
    "documentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second SQL INSERT statement explicitly lists all four columns and\n",
    "inserts new values appropriately. The final SQL INSERT statement lists\n",
    "only three columns and inserts only three values. The description column\n",
    "is left empty, which means it will have a NULL value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although single-row SQL INSERT statements can be useful, when you need\n",
    "to insert multiple rows, it's more efficient to do so directly, as shown\n",
    "below:\n",
    "\n",
    "    INSERT INTO myProducts(itemNumber, price, stockDate, description)\n",
    "    VALUES (4, 29.95, '2015-02-10', 'Male bathing suit, blue'),\n",
    "           (5, 49.95, '2015-02-20', 'Female bathing suit, one piece, aqua'),\n",
    "           (6, 9.95, '2015-01-15', 'Child sand toy set'),\n",
    "           (7, 24.95, '2014-12-20', 'White beach towel'),\n",
    "           (8, 32.95, '2014-12-22', 'Blue-striped beach towel'),\n",
    "           (9, 12.95, '2015-03-12', 'Flip-flop'),\n",
    "           (10, 34.95, '2015-01-24', 'Open-toed sandal') ;\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we insert seven rows into the database by explicitly\n",
    "listing all four columns and providing new values for each row. As\n",
    "discussed earlier, multiple-row inserts enclose the values for each new\n",
    "row within parentheses, and these values are separated by commas. \n",
    "\n",
    "To actually execute these statements, we can place the SQL INSERT\n",
    "statements in a script file and run the script to insert the data. This\n",
    "approach lets you more easily fix errors or reinsert the data if\n",
    "necessary without recreating the requisite SQL INSERT statements. In the\n",
    "following code cells, we first create a SQL INSERT script file, before\n",
    "executing this script by using the `sqlite3` client tool. After this, we\n",

    "### SELECT\n",
    "\n",
    "In the SQL programming language, the task of performing a query falls to\n",
    "the SELECT statement. To provide all the query functionality required by\n",
    "database applications, the SELECT statement's capabilities are\n",
    "extensive. Before looking at example SELECT statements, lets first look\n",
    "at the  formal syntax of SELECT, which, as shown below is actually\n",
    "simple. The basic format is `SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE;`, you select the\n",
    "columns of interest from rows in a table or tables where certain\n",
    "conditions are satisfied. Of course, things can become considerably more\n",
    "complex. This article covers the basic features of SELECT and defers the\n",
    "more advanced issues to subsequent articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT [ DISTINCT | ALL ] SelectItem [ , SelectItem ]*\n",
    "FROM clause\n",
    "[ WHERE clause ]\n",
    "[ GROUP BY clause ]\n",
    "[ HAVING clause ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From this you can see that a basic SELECT statement requires only a\n",
    "SELECT and a FROM; you must specify what data to select and indicate the\n",
    "location of the data of interest. Everything else is optional (as\n",
    "indicated by the square brackets). The DISTINCT and ALL keywords are\n",
    "optional qualifiers to indicate that either rows with unique values or\n",
    "all rows should be selected, respectively. By default, ALL is implicitly\n",
    "assumed, and you can use only one DISTINCT qualifier per SELECT\n",
    "statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "A SELECT statement can have multiple columns listed following the SELECT\n",
    "keyword. Multiple elements (or, more generally, column names) are\n",
    "separated by commas. For example, `SELECT a, b, c` selects the three\n",
    "columns a, b, and c. To select all columns from a table, you can use the\n",
    "asterisk character (\\*) as a shorthand for all columns. An important\n",
    "point to remember is that the result of any SELECT statement is a\n",
    "transient SQLite table, and you can use it in many of the same ways you\n",
    "use a more permanent table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FROM component of a SELECT statement indicates from which table (or\n",
    "multiple tables) the data will be extracted. For now, we will focus on\n",
    "selecting data from a single table; latter we will cover table joins and\n",
    "selecting data from multiple tables. In this case, the fully qualified\n",
    "name of the table to query must follow the FROM keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the SELECT statement is optional. Before you build your\n",
    "first query, however, lets review the order in which the SELECT\n",
    "statement components are evaluated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. FROM clause\n",
    "2. WHERE clause\n",
    "3. GROUP BY clause\n",
    "4. HAVING clause\n",
    "5. SELECT clause\n",
    "\n",
    "When you break down the process SQLite follows when processing a query,\n",
    "this order is intuitive. First you must locate the data to be analyzed,\n",
    "after which you filter out the rows of interest. The next steps are to\n",
    "group related rows and, finally, to select the actual columns of\n",
    "interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQLite\n",
    "\n",

    "| * | p.price * 1.0825 | Multiplies the first value by the second value |\n",
    "| / | p.price / 100.0 | Divides the first value by the second value |\n",

    "return the price for an item both before and after sales tax has been\n",
    "applied by using `SELECT price, price * 1.0825 FROM myProducts ;`. As\n",
    "another example, if you have a column called `numberItems` that tracks\n",
    "the number of items purchased and another column called `price` that\n",

    "same data type, the result type will be the same. If you're performing\n",
    "division, this can result in truncation (for example, if you're using\n",
    "two integer values), which might cause unexpected problems. On the other\n",

    "promoted to the more complex type.\n",

    "### SQL Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is a powerful and expressive language that can be used to perform a\n",
    "wide range of actions. Part of the SQL language's power comes from its\n",

    "Of these built-in functions, we will most likely use the aggregate\n",
    "functions, which operate on multiple rows. Aggregate functions-also\n",
    "known as set functions in SQL-92 or, more informally, as column\n",
    "functions-return a computed quantity from a column over a number of\n",
    "rows. SQLite supports the following five aggregate functions (a sixth\n",
    "function, `group_concat`, is not listed).\n",
    "\n",
    "| Function | Example | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| AVG | AVG(p.price) | Returns the average value of a column from all rows that satisfy an expression. Can only be used with built-in numeric data types. The precision of the returned value is defined by the precision of the column being evaluated. |\n",
    "| COUNT | COUNT(p.price) | Returns the number of rows that satisfy an expression, such as a query. Can be used with any data type. |\n",
    "| MAX | MAX(p.price) | Returns the maximum value of a column from all rows that satisfy an expression. Can only be used with built-in data types. |\n",
    "| MIN | MIN(p.price) | Returns the minimum value of a column from all rows that satisfy an expression. Can only be used with built-in data types. |\n",
    "| SUM | SUM(p.price) | Returns the sum of a column over all rows that satisfy an expression. Can only be used with built-in numeric data types. |\n",

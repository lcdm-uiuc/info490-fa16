    "## Working with files\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with files, or any other system object, we must be careful\n",
    "about properly managing the underlying resource. In this particular\n",
    "case, that means a file and the associated file descriptor that the host\n",
    "operating system uses to reference the actual file. While modern\n",
    "operating systems can typically manage a very large number of file\n",
    "descriptors, when we use virtualization, like with a Docker container,\n",
    "we want to minimize our server footprint. Thus, we need to carefully\n",
    "husband resources like file descriptors to avoid exhausting our server\n",
    "resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a more important aspect is that whenever we open a file, we want to\n",
    "be sure that the file is properly closed, and that any data that a\n",
    "program wrote to the file has actually been written to permanent\n",
    "storage. Thus we need to ensure that every file that was opened has\n",
    "been properly closed. To open a file, Python has an `open` method that\n",
    "opens the named file and returns a file object that you either read from\n",
    "or write to depending on the mode used to open the file. Conversely,\n",
    "Python also has a `close` method that closes the file object. \n",
    "\n",
    "To explicitly state why a file is being opened, the `open` method\n",
    "accepts a _mode_ argument, whose default values is `rt` or _open for\n",
    "reading text data_. The allowed modes are detailed in the following\n",
    "table.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mode | Description |\n",
    "| ---- | ----- |\n",
    "| 'r'  | reading (default) | \n",

    "| 'a'  | writing, append to file if exists |\n",
    "| 'b'  | binary mode |\n",
    "| 't'  | text mode (default) |\n",
    "| '+'  | open for reading and writing |\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, and especially for the purposes of this class, we will only\n",
    "read from a text file or write to a text file when using traditional\n",
    "Python file input and output. Thus, to open a text file named `test.txt`\n",
    "for writing without truncating the existing file contents (i.e.,\n",
    "append), you would use `f = open('test.txt', 'a')` and after all\n",
    "operations on the file are complete, you would use `f.close()` to close\n",
    "the file and release all associated resources. One last item, when\n",
    "opening a file for reading and writing, the `+` mode follows either a\n",
    "`w` to open the file but truncate the file contents, or an `r` to open\n",
    "the file without truncation.\n",

    "As the Python language has become more popular, individuals and\n",

    "developing Python applications. Fortunately, the Python language\n",
    "supports encapsulating code into\n",
    "[modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html), which are\n",

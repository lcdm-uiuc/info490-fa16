The lessons this week will focus on learning about data visualizations.
First, you will learn how visualization masters enable others to _see_
data. Next, you will start using an iPython notebook to make data
visualizations. In particular, you will learn how to make general plots,
and how to create and interpret scatter plots by using the Matplotlib 
and Seaborn libraries.

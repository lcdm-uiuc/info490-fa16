    "For this problem you will perform a similar analysis to Week 4 Problem 1.3 where you aim to find the Northernmost and Southernmost airports. This time you will work with slightly different data and will not be limited to the state of Illinois. Write a function that returns the names of the northernmost and southernmost airports in a given state as defined by latitude (higher latitude means farther north). Your function will likely need to perform the following:\n",
    "1. Read in latitudes from `/home/data_scientist/data/data.csv`\n",
    "2. Read in airport name and state from `/home/data_scientist/data/data.csv`\n",

    "4. Returns a numpy array of the form `array(['Northernmost', 'Southernmost'])`\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use any method you with to get the data from csv into NumPy arrays including `np.loadtxt`. If you choose that route, you may run into encoding issues with the strings in the airport and state columns. To get around this, load the data in as `bytes` then convert to `unicode` as such:\n",

    "`my_array = np.loadtxt('file.csv', dtype=bytes).astype(\"U\")`\n",

You may have the right answer but the wrong dimensions, string encoding, etc. will cause assert tests to fail and you to lose points."

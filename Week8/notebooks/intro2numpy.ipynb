    "As we discused previously, the Python programming language provides a rich set of data\n",
    "structures such as the list, tuple, dictionary, and string, which can\n",
    "greatly simply common programming tasks. Of these, all but the string\n",
    "are heterogeneous, which means they can hold data of different types.\n",
    "This flexibility comes at a cost, however, as it is more expensive in\n",
    "both computational time and storage to maintain an arbitrary collection\n",
    "of data than to hold a pre-defined set of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Advanced) For example, the Python list is implemented (in the\n",
    "[Cython](http://cython.org) implementation) as a variable length array\n",
    "that contains pointers to the objects held in the array. While flexible,\n",
    "it takes time to create, resize, and iterate over, even if the data\n",
    "contained in the list is homogenous. In addition, even though you can\n",
    "create multiple-dimensional lists, creating and working with them is not\n",
    "simple nor intuitive. Yet, many applications require multi-dimensional\n",
    "representation; for example, location on the surface of the Earth or\n",
    "pixel properties in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, these data structures are clearly not designed nor optimized for\n",
    "data intensive computing. Scientific and engineering computing\n",
    "applications have a long history of using optimized data structures and\n",
    "libraries, including codes written in C, Fortran, or MatLab. These\n",
    "applications expect to have vector and matrix data structures and\n",
    "optimized algorithms that can leverage these structures seamlessly. \n",
    "Fortunately, since many data science applications, including\n",
    "statistical and machine learning, are built on this academic legacy, a\n",
    "community of open source developers have built the [Numerical Python\n",
    "(NumPy)](http://numpy.org) library to which is a fundamental numerical\n",
    "package to facilitate scientific computing in Python.\n",

    "NumPy is built around a new, n-dimensional array (`ndarray`) data\n",

    "time, but the array is homogenous. This array can be used to represent a\n",
    "vector (one-dimensional set of numerical values) or matrix\n",
    "(multiple-dimensional set of vectors). Furthermore, NumPy provides\n",
    "additional benefits built on top of the `array` object, including\n",
    "_masked arrays_, _universal functions_, _sampling from random\n",

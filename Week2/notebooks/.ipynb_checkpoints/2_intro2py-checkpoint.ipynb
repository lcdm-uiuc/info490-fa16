    "## Why Python\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python][1] is an open-source, high-level, general purpose programming\n",
    "language that was originally developed by [Guido van Rossum][gv]. [What\n",
    "this means][2] is that anyone can view (and optionally make\n",
    "contributions to) the actual language implementation, the language\n",
    "simplifies many tasks for the programmer, especially when compared to\n",
    "other programming languages like C or Java, and that Python programs can\n",
    "easily be developed to tackle a wide range of problems including network\n",
    "communication, scientific calculations, data processing and archiving\n",
    "tasks and graphical tool development. In addition, the syntax and form\n",
    "of the Python programming language is designed to allow Python programs\n",
    "to be quickly developed, simplifying development time and costs while\n",
    "also reducing maintenance costs since a well-written Python program is\n",
    "easy to comprehend.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Python logo](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A large number of Python modules, which extend the base programming\n",
    "language, have been developed and are now widely used, simplifying the\n",
    "development of new Python programs. These modules can be broadly\n",
    "classified into three types. The first type are commonly used modules\n",
    "that are part of the official Python distribution, know as the [standard\n",
    "library][sl], such as the [`math`][i], [`os.path`][ii], [`pickle`][ip],\n",
    "[`sqlite3`][sql], [`bz2`][iii], or [`csv`][iv] modules. The second type\n",
    "are modules that are also commonly used, but not (yet) part of the\n",
    "official standard library. Relevant example modules in theis type are\n",
    "the [`numpy`][np], [`pandas`][pd], [`matplotlib`][mp], or [`scipy`][sp]\n",
    "modules. The last type of module are developed by communities for a\n",
    "special purpose that are currently less commonly used (but this may\n",
    "change in time). These include modules like the [`seaborn`][sb],\n",
    "[`bokeh`][bk], or [`pygresql`][pg]. Of course, any developer can write a\n",
    "Python module thus offering a wide array of possible add-on\n",
    "functionality. The availability of these extra modules, however, needs\n",
    "to be carefully balanced with the need of a developer is to minimize\n",
    "software dependencies to reduce development and maintenance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is maintained by the Python Software Foundation, and currently\n",
    "comes in [two versions][3]: Python 2 and Python 3, which is\n",
    "intentionally backwards incompatible. Sometime around the turn of the\n",
    "millenium, [Python developers][4] began to consider improvements to the\n",
    "Python language that might produce incompatibilities with the existing\n",
    "Python language. One such change, which has been introduced with Python 3,\n",
    "is that the Python programming language is now consistently object-oriented,\n",
    "now everything is an _object_. These changes were considered necessary\n",
    "to enable the language to continue to grow and develop. The development\n",
    "of this new version, originally entitled Python 3000 or Python 3K, now\n",
    "shortened to just Python 3, took a number of years as new ideas were\n",
    "carefully developed abd tested, and to provide sufficient time for the\n",
    "existing community to participate in the progression of the Python\n",
    "language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, nearly fifteen years later, Python 3 is an improved version of the\n",
    "original Python language and offers a number of [important advances][5].\n",
    "Thus, Python 2 is primarily used to maintain backwards compatibility\n",
    "with legacy Python codes that are too difficult or expensive to port to\n",
    "the newer version. Python 3 also uniformly  In this class, we will\n",
    "exclusively use Python 3 since it represents the future and all\n",
    "libraries we will use have already been successfully ported to the new\n",
    "version. As you browse different websites, IPython notebooks, or other\n",
    "resources, you should keep in mind this language split and be sure to\n",
    "focus primarily on Python 3 material in order to minimize confusion\n",

    "Python programming language. A fundamental concept to remember is that\n",
    "good Python code should be easy to read. To help programmers adhere to\n",
    "this guideline, Python has the following guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. White space is important,\n",
    "2. Names should be descriptive,\n",
    "3. Code blocks are indented four spaces (not hard tabs) and follow a colon,\n",
    "4. Lines of code should be limited to less than 80 characters, and\n",
    "5. Good code should be throughly documented both with comments and\n",
    "descriptive documentation strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "If lines need to be longer than 80 characters, the recommend practice is\n",
    "to use parentheses to group operations and to use suitable indentation\n",
    "to maintain readability. In the event this is insufficient, a line\n",

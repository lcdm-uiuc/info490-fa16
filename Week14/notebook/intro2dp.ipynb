    "executed by an engine written in C in order to provide fast execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, most characters in a regular expression simply match\n",
    "themselves, For example `python` would match any occurrence of the six\n",
    "letters `python` either alone or embedded in another word. There are\n",
    "several special characters, known as metacharacters, that control the\n",
    "behaviour of the rest of the regular expression. These metacharacters are\n",
    "listed in the following table.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metacharacter | Meaning | Example |\n",
    "| ---- | ----- | ----- |\n",
    "| . |  Matches any character except a newline | `1.3` matches `123`, `1a3`, and `1#3` among others |\n",
    "| ^ | Matches sequence at the beginning of the line| `^Python` matches `Python` at the beginning of a line |\n",
    "| $ | Matches sequence at the end of the line | `Python$` matches `Python` at the end of a line |\n",
    "| * | Matches zero or more occurrences of a pattern | `12*3` matches `13`, `123`, `1223`, etc. |\n",
    "| + |  Matches one or more occurrences of a pattern | `12+3` matches `123`, `1223`, etc. |\n",
    "| ? |  Matches zero or one occurrences of a pattern | `12?3` matches `13` and `123` |\n",
    "| { }| Match repeated qualifier | `{m, n}` means match at least `m` and at most `n` occurrences | \n",
    "| [ ] | Used to specify a character class | `[a-z]` means match any lower case character |\n",
    "| \\ | Escape character | `\\w` means match and alphanumeric character, and `\\\\` means match a backslash |\n",
    "| &#124; | or operator | `A ` &#124; ` B` match either `A` or `B` |\n",
    "| ( ) | Grouping Operator | (a, b) |\n",
